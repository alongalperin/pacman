# PAC-MAN by Alon
  
This game created as assignment to Internet Development course I took in Ben Gurion University, Israel, May 2017.  
  
[Demo:](http://pac-game.000webhostapp.com/Final%20Game/index.html "Demo")
  
__The game and the site were developed using:__
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery
5. Bootstrap  
The ghosts are chasing pacman using A* algorithm, which search the shortest way to reach pacman.  
  
Enjoy :(
